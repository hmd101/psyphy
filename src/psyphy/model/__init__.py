psyphy.model
============

Model-layer API: everything model-related in one place.

Includes
--------
- WPPM (core model)
- Priors (Prior)
- Tasks (TaskLikelihood base, OddityTask)
- Noise models (GaussianNoise, StudentTNoise)

All functions/classes use JAX arrays (jax.numpy as jnp) for autodiff
and optimization with Optax.

Typical usage
-------------

geometry
========

Covariance-to-ellipse geometry, with no plotting dependency.

These helpers turn stacks of 2x2 covariance matrices into polyline vertices
that any plotting backend can draw, and compute a magnification that makes a
field of ellipses legible on its own grid. They import only numpy and scipy,
both core psyphy dependencies, so they can be used (and tested) without
matplotlib installed.

See :mod:`psyphy.viz.ellipses` for the matplotlib drawing layer.

    Each covariance is drawn as its 1-standard-deviation ellipse,
    ``{c + scale * L u : |u| = 1}`` where ``L`` is the Cholesky factor of the
    covariance. The ellipse's semi-axes are therefore ``scale * sqrt(lambda_i)``
    for eigenvalues ``lambda_i``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    centers : array_like, shape (n_points, 2)
        Ellipse centers, typically the reference stimuli.
    covs : array_like, shape (n_points, 2, 2)
        Covariance matrix per center.
    scale : float, default=1.0
        Multiplies every semi-axis. ``1.0`` draws true size; see
        :func:`auto_scale` for a grid-aware value.
    n_points : int, default=100
        Vertices per ellipse.

    Returns
    -------
    segments : list of np.ndarray
        One ``(n_points, 2)`` array per **positive-definite** covariance, in
        input order. Shorter than ``centers`` when some are skipped.
    valid : np.ndarray of bool, shape (n_points,)
        Which covariances were positive-definite and therefore drawn.

    Notes
    -----
    Non-positive-definite covariances are skipped rather than raising, because
    a single bad matrix should not discard an otherwise usable field. Callers
    should surface ``valid.sum() < len(valid)`` to the user rather than ignore
    it -- a silently thinned field is hard to notice by eye.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> segs, valid = ellipse_segments(np.zeros((1, 2)), np.eye(2)[None])
    >>> bool(valid.all()), segs[0].shape
    (True, (100, 2))

    """Scale factor that fits a field of ellipses to its own grid.

    Sizes the *median* ellipse so its typical radius is ``fraction`` of the
    median nearest-neighbour spacing between centers. This adapts to the grid
    rather than assuming one: the same call gives a readable figure on a coarse
    7x7 grid and on a dense 103x103 one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    centers : array_like, shape (n_points, 2)
        Ellipse centers. At least two are required, since the spacing is a
        nearest-neighbour distance.
    covs : array_like, shape (n_points, 2, 2)
        Covariance matrix per center.
    fraction : float, default=0.35
        Target ratio of typical ellipse radius to typical center spacing.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Multiplier to pass as ``scale``.

    Notes
    -----
    **This is not always a magnification.** On a dense grid the factor can be
    well below 1, shrinking ellipses so neighbours do not overlap. On the Hong
    et al. (2025) data it is ~1.24 for the 49-point threshold grid and ~0.22
    for the 10 609-point noise grid.

    Because it rescales, a figure drawn with it cannot be read for *absolute*
    size. When comparing several fields, compute the factor **once** and apply
    it to all of them, or relative sizes become meaningless;
    :func:`psyphy.viz.plot_ellipses` enforces this.

    Uses a KD-tree rather than a full pairwise distance matrix, which would be
    O(n^2) in time and memory -- negligible at n=49, about 1.8 GB at n=10 609.

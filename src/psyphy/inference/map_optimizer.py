map_optimizer.py
----------------

MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) optimizer using Optax.

MVP implementation:
- Uses gradient ascent on log posterior.
- Defaults to SGD with momentum, but any Optax optimizer can be passed in.

Connections
-----------
- Calls WPPM.log_posterior_from_data(params, data) as the objective.
- Returns a Posterior object wrapping the MAP estimate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int
            Number of optimization steps.
        optimizer : optax.GradientTransformation | None
            Optax optimizer to use.
        learning_rate : float, optional
            Learning rate for the default optimizer (SGD with momentum).

        reduction : {"mean", "sum"}, optional
            How to scale the objective before differentiating.

            - ``"mean"`` (default): divide the negative log posterior by the
              number of trials N, giving a *per-trial* objective.
              (Hong et al. 2025, elife, used this and no gradient clipping)
            - ``"sum"``: use the negative log posterior as-is.

            The two objectives differ by the positive constant N, so they have
            the **same minimizer**, and with no gradient clipping they trace an
            identical path under ``lr_sum = lr_mean / N``. The choice matters
            for two practical reasons:

            1. **Learning-rate portability.** Under ``"sum"``, gradient
               magnitude grows with N, so ``learning_rate`` must be retuned
               whenever the dataset size changes. Under ``"mean"`` the gradient
               is an average of per-trial gradients, so a working learning rate
               transfers across dataset sizes.
            2. **Gradient clipping.** ``max_grad_norm`` is a fixed threshold.
               Under ``"sum"`` the raw gradient norm scales with N, so the clip
               saturates on essentially every step for realistic N — which
               discards gradient *magnitude* and silently turns SGD into
               normalized fixed-step descent.

               To disable it entirely (e.g. to match a reference implementation
               that does no clipping) pass ``max_grad_norm=None``.

            Note that the *model* is unaffected: ``WPPM.log_posterior_from_data``
            still returns the true (summed) log posterior. Scaling is
            step-size conditioning and lives here, in the optimizer, so that
            density-based consumers (e.g. a Laplace approximation taking the
            Hessian at the mode) keep seeing the unnormalized log posterior.

            Because the recorded loss is per-trial under ``"mean"``, learning
            curves are not comparable to those produced with ``"sum"``: the
            values differ by a factor of N.
        track_history : bool, optional
            When True, record loss history during fitting for plotting.
        log_every : int, optional
            Record every N steps (also records the last step).
        progress_every : int, optional
            Update the progress-bar loss display every N steps (and the last step)
            when show_progress=True.
            This is kept separate from log_every so you can record loss at high
            frequency for plotting (e.g. log_every=1) without forcing a device->host
            sync for the progress UI every step.
        show_progress : bool, optional
            When True, display a tqdm progress bar during fitting.
            This is a UI feature: if tqdm is not installed,
            fitting proceeds without a progress bar.
        max_grad_norm : float | None, optional
            If set, clip gradients by global norm to this value before applying
            optimizer updates: ``g <- g * min(1, max_grad_norm / ||g||)``.

            **Off by default.** Clipping is a guard rail against rare gradient
            spikes, and only behaves as one when the threshold sits *above* the
            typical gradient norm so that it binds on a small fraction of steps.
            A threshold below the typical norm binds on every step, which fixes
            the step length at ``learning_rate * max_grad_norm`` regardless of
            gradient magnitude -- that is normalized gradient descent, a
            different algorithm, and it makes ``learning_rate`` non-transferable
            (only the product of the two matters).

            The typical norm is model- and data-dependent, so there is no safe
            universal default; for the WPPM it is O(10^2)-O(10^3). Choose a
            threshold from the observed distribution rather than a convention
            borrowed from deep-learning recipes, and check
            :attr:`clip_rate` after :meth:`fit` to confirm which regime you are
            in. Note this is orthogonal to ``reduction``: under ``"sum"`` the
            norm additionally scales with the trial count N, but a mis-set
            threshold saturates under ``"mean"`` too.

        Attributes

        clip_rate : float | None
            Fraction of steps on which gradient clipping bound, populated after
            :meth:`fit`. ``None`` when ``max_grad_norm`` is ``None``. A value
            near 1.0 means clipping is not acting as a guard rail but as a
            change of optimizer.

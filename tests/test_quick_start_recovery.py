test_quick_start_recovery.py
----------------------------

Regression test for the quick-start tutorial's headline claim: fitting a WPPM
to data simulated from a known WPPM recovers the ground-truth covariance.

This exists because the tutorial's committed figure once showed a good fit that
the committed code could not reproduce -- the fit had silently collapsed to zero
covariance and nothing caught it, because "the script ran without error" was the
only check.

The settings were first calibrated on a local, current jax install, and the
first version of this test failed immediately on CI. The reason: CI's ``tests``
job floor-tests against ``jax==0.4.28`` (see ``.github/workflows/lint.yml``),
which is not just numerically different from a current jax but draws different
samples from the *same* ``PRNGKey`` -- so ground truth, init and data are a
different problem instance per jax version, not a noisy variant of the same one.
At low trial counts (checked from n=10 to n=60) the outcome is not a clean
"collapses to zero" failure either; it is chaotic across both seed and jax
version, landing anywhere from near-zero to a several-times overshoot to a
numerical blow-up. There is no trial count in that range where a specific
failure shape is portable, so this file does not try to pin one -- see
``test_too_few_trials_is_not_pinned_here`` below.

The settings here (1000 trials, not the tutorial's original 100) mirror
``docs/examples/wppm/quick_start.py``, calibrated to recover the ground truth
with margin across both the jax version floor CI pins to and a current jax,
each over several seeds. If that script's compute settings change, change them
here too -- the point is to pin the tutorial's result, not an arbitrary
configuration.

# Deliberately no "too few trials fails predictably" test. An earlier version
# asserted that 100 trials reliably collapses the fit to near-zero covariance
# and failed immediately in CI (jax==0.4.28): under that version's draw from
# the same seeds, the same config *overshot* by 1.35x instead -- see the module
# docstring for why. A sweep from n=10 to n=60 (both jax pins, three seeds
# each) found no trial count with a portable failure shape: outcomes ranged
# from a ~100x collapse to a several-times overshoot to a numerical blow-up
# (area ratio > 1e6), depending on seed and jax version alike. A version-robust
# version of that test would need to characterize instability statistically
# (e.g. dispersion across an ensemble of seeds) rather than pin one seed's
# outcome -- worth adding if this module regresses again, but heavier than a
# quick regression script warrants today.
